REACT_APP_BACKEND_API="http://localhost:5000"
This is the file to keep environment variables e.g. API keys, secrets, and passwords. One purpose of this file is to stop passwords from being checked into GitHub (where everyone could read them), and the other is to allow different settings on different "environments". For example, on Netlify, you wouldn't want to be calling localhost.
